          <section class="content"><p>Back in January I posted an article about <a href="/articles/waking-up-at-5am-to-code/">waking up at 5am to code</a>. It seemed to really strike a chord with a lot of people. Lately I’ve been getting a handful of emails asking me if I still do this and where I’m at with it now. So I thought I’d post a quick follow&nbsp;up.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo&nbsp;wood-cutter.</p>
<p>He was very poor and sad also, for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave. Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky. When he had made his choice, he would cut down these feathers of the forest, and splitting them lengthwise, or cutting them into joints, would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household, and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Someone on Hacker News once mentioned they do this, and it stuck in the back of my head ever since. I’ve been at this for two weeks thus&nbsp;far.</p>
